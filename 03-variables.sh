# Variable name can comprise - a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _

# Python Background - snake_case - variable_name

# Data - Free to give anything, No data type, Everything is string.

# Command substitution

# Often to deal with expressions in better we use a cli tool called as bc rather than this, this substitution will help you with basic operations.


# Scenarios.
# 1. We can overwrite the variable
# x=10
# x=20
# second time x will get replaced with out any warnings or errors.

# Assume example.sh is havign the following code.
# echo x - $x

# 2. Variables declared in CLI cannot be accessed when we execute the script
# x=20
# bash example.sh
# some times we need to send the x value to the script and it can be done in three ways.

# a. Special Variables
# bash example.sh $x

# b. before to script
# x=20 bash example.sh

# c. Mark variable as environment variable
# export x=20
# bash example.sh
